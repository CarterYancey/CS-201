Space complexity for loops: constant
Space complexity for recursion: number of calls
Two independent loops: the highest order loop
Nested: multiply the complexities

Dynamic arrays grow in linear time with additive, constant with multiplitive. 
195 is D
complete are perfect, perfect are not complete
perfect are full,
full are not complete
complete are not full
2^h-1 number of nodes for perfect tree
