function f(x,n)
 if (x < n)
  print(x);
  f(x+pow(n, 0.5), n) //runs ins sqrt(n) time and sqrt(n) space


(logn)^a  //polylogarithmic
n^b //polynomial
(logn)^a = o(n^b) 

//logn is essentially 1
logn = o(n)
logn = o(n^.5)
logn = o(n^.0000001)


log(logn) = o(logn)
log*n is log recursively until you get to one

1.00001^n = w(n^5)
