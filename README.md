# CS-201
In the spring of 2017, I took a data structures and algorithms class at The University of Alabama. I am moving the projects we did from my local machine to here.

This folder is a direct copy of the directory on my laptop that I used to store all project files and class notes while taking the class. I discovered it deep in the swamp of my backups and decided to relocate it here.

Because this folder is unorganized and contains many (potentially) useless files and messy code, it should probably be ignored.
I plan to create a new directory that will contain the cleaned-up code for my projects to serve as an example of the kinds of data structures and algorithms we learned to create.
